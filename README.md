# DeepSeek-Memory
DeepSeek Memory is a Python-based interactive terminal application that augments a local Large Language Model (LLM) with persistent memory. It leverages **Ollama** to run a local LLM (e.g., **DeepSeek-R1:1.5b** or any other model you choose) and maintains conversation history across sessions.
